 > __read Thermo .RAW data into R__

#### What is rawReadeR ?

`rawReadeR` is an R/C++ API to the `MSFileReader.dll`.  `rawReadeR` allows for m/z profiles and scan header data to be extracted from `.RAW` files without the need for manual extraction using `Xcalibur` or conversion to a more universal format (`.mzML`, `.mZXML`, etc...)

#### Installation
 __N.B `rawReadeR` can only be installed on a Windows Operating System__. Microsoft Visual Studio also needs to be installed to allow for compilation of `.cpp` files. 

##### Step 1
 - [Download](https://thermo.flexnetoperations.com/control/thmo/login?nextURL=%2Fcontrol%2Fthmo%2Fdownload%3Felement%3D63066 77) the `MSFileReader`
 - The `MSFileReader` filepath needs to be `C:\Thermo\MSFileReader.XRawfile2.dll`
 - The `.dll` can then be registered using the following command from a Command Prompt with Administrator privileges 
  ```sh 
  regsvr32 C:\Thermo\MSFileReader.XRawfile2.dll
  ```
  
##### Step 2 
 - Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/wilsontom/rawReadeR
```
##### Step 3
To prevent having to distibute compied executables with the package, these need to be compiled prior to package installation. Start a new R session and enter the following;

```R
setwd("rawReadeR")
options(VSPATH = "<path_to_visual_studio_vcvars32.bat>")
source("rawReadeR/R/compileAll.R") 
compileAll(getwd())
```

##### Step 4
Finally, build and install.

```sh
R CMD build RawReadeR
R CMD INSTALL RawReadeR_0.1.0_tar.gz
```
##### Step 5
To check everything has compiled and installed ok...
```R
library(rawReadeR
testPackage(scans = c(1:10)
```

This package was inspired by a similar effort using [MATLAB and the mex complier](https://github.com/jgoldford/msfilereader-matlab-api). Also, [Galaxy-M](https://github.com/Viant-Metabolomics/Galaxy-M) contains a excellent Python parser for MSfilereader which was helpful during development of this package
